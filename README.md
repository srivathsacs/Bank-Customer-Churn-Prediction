# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

The aim of this project is to build a robust deep learning model which helps bank in predicting the customers who are at high risk of leaving the bank.The dataset contains the bank customer details as the features and the target variable is "Exited",which says whether the person is exited from the bank or not.

# Instructions for Execution
->-> Install relevant libraries and packages from requirements.txt file

->-> To install all of these at once, simply run

     Windows: pip install -r requirements.txt

     Ubuntu: sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
->-> Place the dataset in the dataset folder, and modify the path in the helpers.py file to read the dataset.

->-> Go to Anaconda prompt and activate Tensorflow Environment (Tensorflow GPU Environment Preferred).

->-> Move to the directory "Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction", and write the following command to execute the application

     Windows : python customer_churn.py

     Ubuntu: sudo python customer_churn.py
->-> The application will be executed and the results will be shown on the Command Line Terminal.For visulizations, run the customer_churn.py as an ipynb file on Jupyter Notebook, inside the Anaconda Tensorflow environment.
